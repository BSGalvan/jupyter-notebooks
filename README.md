This is a collection of all codes written as part of ES414 - Computational Astrophysics, and one assignment from ES413 - Planetary Sciences.
These are all in the form of Jupyter Notebooks, so make sure you have Jupyter and related dependencies installed.
Better yet, just [install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) because you'll also need NumPy, matplotlib and additional dependencies to be able to run some of the notebooks.
A brief overview of all the topics covered here:
- Basic Python Overview
- Root Finding
- Interpolation
- Numerical Differentiation
- Numerical Integration
- Curve Fitting
- Parameter Estimation
- Numerical Solutions of Parabolic PDEs
